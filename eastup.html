    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    </div>
    <p >
        The Culture of Uttar Pradesh is an Indian culture which has its roots in Hindi and Urdu literature, music, fine
        arts, drama and cinema. Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh, has historical monuments including Bara Imambara
        and Chhota Imambara, and has preserved the damaged complex of the Oudh-period British Resident's quarters, which
        are being restored.
        Varanasi's ghats (bathing steps along the river) draws pilgrims year-round who bathe in the Ganges River.
        Mathura's celebrations of the Holi festival attract many tourists.
        Thousands gather at Allahabad (Prayagraj) to take part in the annual Magh Mela festival on the banks of the
        Ganges which is organised on a larger scale every 12th year, when it is called the Kumbha Mela, where over 10
        million Hindu pilgrims congregate – one of the largest gathering of human beings in the world. Badaun is a
        religiously significant city whose historical monuments and tombs attract thousand of tourists annually.
        The historical towns of Sarnath and Kushinagar are not far from Varanasi. Gautama Buddha gave his first sermon
        at Sarnath and died at Kushinagar; both are important pilgrimage sites for Buddhists. Also at Sarnath are the
        Pillars of Ashoka and the Lion Capital of Ashoka, archaeological artefacts with national significance.[further
        explanation needed] Ghazipur, 80 km from Varanasi, has Ganges Ghats and the Tomb of British potentate Lord
        Cornwallis, maintained by the Archaeologic survey of India.

    <h3>2. Architecture</h3>
    <p>The architecture of Uttar Pradesh demonstrates a diverse and eclectic combination of Buddhist, Hindu,
        Indo-Islamic, and Indo-European architectural styles. Three of its architectural monuments—the Taj Mahal, the
        Agra Fort, as well as the township of Fatehpur Sikri founded by the Mughal emperor Akbar—are designated UNESCO
        World Heritage Sites. The architectural structures in Uttar Pradesh include ancient Buddhist stūpas and vihāras,
        ancient Buddhist and Hindu monasteries, townships, forts, palaces, temples, mosques, mausoleums, memorials, and
        other community structures. Uttar Pradesh's architectural structures also include various Hindu temples, Ghats,
        etc. largely found in ancient cities like Benares (Varanasi), Brindaban (Vrindavan), Mathura, and Prayagraj
        (Allahabad).</p>

    <h3>3. Dance and Music</h3>
    <p>During the Gupta and Harsh Vardhan eras, Uttar Pradesh was a centre for musical innovation. Swami Haridas was a
        musician who championed Hindustani Classical Music. Tansen, a musician in Mughal Emperor Akbar's court, was a
        disciple of Swami Haridas.
        Kathak is a classical dance form from Uttar Pradesh. Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, was a patron and
        champion of Kathak. Today, the state is home to two prominent schools of this dance form, Lucknow Gharana and
        Banaras Gharana.
        Music personalities including Naushad Ali, Talat Mehmood, Begum Akhtar , Anup Jalota, Shubha Mudgal, Bismillah
        Khan, Ravi Shankar, Kishan Maharaj, Vikash Maharaj, Hari Prasad Chaurasia, Gopal Shankar Misra, Siddheshwari
        Devi, Girija Devi and Sir Cliff Richard were originally from Uttar Pradesh.
        The region's folk heritage includes songs called rasiya (especially popular in Braj), which celebrate the
        mythological love of Radha and Krishna. These songs are accompanied by large drums known as bumb and are
        performed at many festivals. Other folk dances or folk theater forms include Raslila, Swang, Ramlila (a dramatic
        enactment of the entire Ramayana), Nautanki, Naqal (mimicry) and Qawwali.
        The Bhatkhande Music Institute is situated in Lucknow.

    <h3>4. Languages</h3>
    <p>The common state-language of Uttar Pradesh is standard Hindi. While standard Hindi (Khari boli) is the official
        language, several regional Hindi 'dialects' are spoken in the state including: Awadhi, Bhojpuri, Braj, Kannauji,
        Bagheli and Bundeli, as well as several local dialects that do not have a formal name. Urdu is prominent in
        Uttar Pradesh as Lucknow was once the centre of Indo-Persianate culture in north India. The language of Lucknow
        ("Lakhnavi Urdu") is a form of high literary Urdu.</p>

    <h3>5. Tourism</h3>
    <p>Uttar Pradesh attracts large number of visitors, both national and international; with more than 71 million
        domestic tourists (in 2003) and almost 25% of the All-India foreign tourists visiting Uttar Pradesh, it is one
        of the top tourist destinations in India. There are two regions in the state where a majority of the tourists
        go, the Hindu pilgrimage circuit and the Agra circuit.
        The pilgrimage circuit includes the most religiously prestigious of the cities considered holy in Hinduism on
        the banks of the Ganges and Yamuna, rivers which are also considered sacred: Varanasi, Ayodhya (in mythology the
        birthplace of Rama), Mathura (in mythology the birthplace of Krishna), Vrindavan (in mythology where Krishna
        spent his childhood), and Allahabad (Prayagraj) (the confluence or 'holy-sangam' of the Ganges-Yamuna
        rivers).[citation needed]
        The city of Agra is near three World Heritage Sites: Taj Mahal, Agra Fort and the nearby Fatehpur Sikri.[1] Taj
        Mahal is a mausoleum built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It is cited
        as "the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage".
        Agra Fort is about 2.5 km northwest of its much more famous sister monument, the Taj Mahal. The fort can be more
        accurately described as a walled palatial city. Fatehpur Sikri was the 16th-century capital city near Agra,
        built by the Mughal emperor Akbar the Great, whose mausoleum is in Agra. Dayal Bagh in Agra is a modern-day
        temple and tourist site with lifelike marble sculptures. Agra's attractions alsoinclude Asia's largest spa as
        well as Asia's second 6D theatre.[citation needed]
        Prem Mandir, Vrindavan, is called the "temple of love."
        Some of the main natural protected areas in Uttar Pradesh are:-
        • Dudhwa National Park is one of the best tiger reserves in the country.
        • Pilibhit Tiger Reserve – home to the Tiger Reserve.situated in district Pilibhit.

        as well as leopards – situated in Bahraich and bordering Nepal is also worth a visit.
        Some areas require a special permit for non-Indians to visit.
